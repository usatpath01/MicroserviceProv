Frontend: A web interface for users to interact with the application.
API Gateway: Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
User Service: Handles user authentication and management.
Photo Service: Manages photo uploads and retrieval.
User DB and Photo DB: MySQL databases for storing user and photo data.

This setup includes the following vulnerabilities:

SQL Injection: In both user_service and photo_service, SQL queries are constructed using string interpolation.
Insecure File Upload: The photo_service doesn't properly validate uploaded files.
Sensitive Data Exposure: The user_service exposes sensitive information like passwords in API responses.
Broken Authentication: The user_service has a weak password policy.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The frontend doesn't properly sanitize user input when displaying photo filenames.
